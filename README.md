# Snek
Java 401d3 final project component [Snake Game](https://drivebadly.firebaseapp.com/)

This part of our Java final project used HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to build a snake game. It listens to Cloud Firebase Firestore to make controlling from our [Android App](https://github.com/401javafinal6-21-19/Car-Driver) or our [Twitch Chat Bot](https://glitch.com/~drivebadlybot) possible. 

Project includes an HTML [testing page](public/_test_/test.html).

## Snake Web App
### Snake Game Features
1. **Hosted on firebase**
2. **Donut implementation** - when the snake moves off one side it reappears on the opposing side. 
3. **Collision** - the game restarts when the snake collides with itself.
