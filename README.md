# snek
Java 401d3 final project backup snake game for [RC car](https://github.com/401javafinal6-21-19/A-Car-You-Can-Only-Drive-Badly) controller. 

This part of our Java final project used HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to build a snake game. It listens to Cloud Firebase Firestore to make controlling from our [Android App](https://github.com/401javafinal6-21-19/Car-Driver) possible. 

Project includes an HTML [testing page](public/_test_/test.html).
